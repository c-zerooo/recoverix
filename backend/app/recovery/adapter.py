"""
adapter.py — Clean adapter converting canonical RecoveryRun to ArtifactResponse.

Bridging layer between the canonical tracing recovery engine (RecoveryRun)
and the case-analysis artifact representation (ArtifactResponse).

FORENSIC INTEGRITY PRINCIPLES:
  1. Strict representation conversion only — never recalculate, infer, guess,
     upgrade, or downgrade confidence or status.
  2. Artifact identity is never invented — the caller must provide artifact_id
     or it must already exist on RecoveryRun. The adapter never fabricates a UUID.
  3. Payload size (size_bytes) represents the actual recovered payload size in bytes.
     If no recovered payload bytes are available, size_bytes is 0. Accounting totals
     (V, R, M) are preserved in provenance, never fabricated into size_bytes.
  4. Byte semantics (verified_bytes, reconstructed_bytes, missing_bytes) are
     strictly preserved without modification or fabrication.
  5. Previews are extracted solely from legitimate recovery output, never from
     re-reading disk evidence or hallucinating missing bytes.
  6. Confidence representation: canonical integer confidence scores are preserved
     exactly. When non-integer inputs are provided, explicit representation conversion
     to integer schema requirements is applied without introducing a new scoring algorithm.
     Empty/untested confidence defaults to 0 rather than inventing unearned scores.
  7. Contract compliance: null placeholders (category=None, priority=None,
     ai_summary=None) and integer score breakdowns are strictly preserved.

    Representation Conversion Notes:
      - The canonical scoring engine (ConfidenceBreakdown) natively produces integer
        scores for total and all 5 component dimensions. When integer values are present,
        they are preserved exactly without alteration.
      - If non-integer numeric values (floats) are encountered from arbitrary inputs,
        a deterministic representation conversion (int(round(float(val)))) is applied
        solely to satisfy the integer schema requirement of ConfidenceBreakdownSchema.
      - Component sum is verified against total; any single-unit rounding difference
        from float conversion is reconciled against structural_validation (highest weight)
        to preserve the API schema contract: sum(components) == total.
      - If confidence_dict is absent/empty:
          - If status is UNRECOVERABLE: scores are 0.
          - Otherwise: scores default to 0 to avoid fabricating unverified confidence scores.
