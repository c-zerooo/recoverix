"""
json.py — Deterministic JSON reconstruction engine.

Recovers JSON evidence by establishing, from the surviving bytes alone, which
structural bytes are *forced* by the evidence and which are genuinely unknown.

The engine never invents content. It distinguishes two cases that are often
conflated:

  1. **Deterministically closable** — the evidence is a proper prefix of a JSON
     document: every token is complete and the document is only awaiting closing
     brackets. The closing sequence is uniquely determined by the open container
     stack, so those bytes are emitted and counted as ``reconstructed_bytes``.

  2. **Unknown missing content** — the truncation lands on an incomplete token
     (unterminated string, partial number, partial literal), on a dangling
     ``:`` or ``,``, or where a further element could still appear. The missing
     value cannot be known, so nothing is invented. The unusable trailing bytes
     are reported as ``missing_bytes`` and the verified prefix is preserved.

A third case, genuinely malformed evidence that was never a JSON prefix, is
rejected safely as unrecoverable with every byte accounted as missing.

FORENSIC INVARIANT
    Every emitted byte is either a verified evidence byte or a deterministic
    structural repair byte, and the two together account for the whole output::

        verified_bytes + reconstructed_bytes == len(recovered_bytes)

    Every input byte is either emitted as verified evidence or explicitly
    dropped as missing::

        verified_bytes + missing_bytes == len(input)

    Together these give the artifact budget used by the recovery architecture::

        verified_bytes + reconstructed_bytes + missing_bytes == artifact budget
